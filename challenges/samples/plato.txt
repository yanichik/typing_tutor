Plato is one of the world's best known and most widely read and studied
philosophers. He was the student of Socrates and the teacher of Aristotle,
and he wrote in the middle of the fourth century B.C.E. in ancient Greece.
Though influenced primarily by Socrates, to the extent that Socrates is usually
the main character in many of Plato's writings, he was also influenced by Heraclitus,
Parmenides, and the Pythagoreans. There are varying degrees of controversy over which
of Plato's works are authentic, and in what order they were written, due to their
antiquity and the manner of their preservation through time. Nonetheless, his earliest
works are generally regarded as the most reliable of the ancient sources on Socrates,
and the character Socrates that we know through these writings is considered to be one
of the greatest of the ancient philosophers. Plato's middle to later works, including
his most famous work, the Republic, are generally regarded as providing Plato's own
philosophy, where the main character in effect speaks for Plato himself. These works
blend ethics, political philosophy, moral psychology, epistemology, and metaphysics
into an interconnected and systematic philosophy. It is most of all from Plato that we get
the theory of Forms, according to which the world we know through the senses is only an
imitation of the pure, eternal, and unchanging world of the Forms. Plato's works also
contain the origins of the familiar complaint that the arts work by inflaming the passions,
and are mere illusions. We also are introduced to the ideal of "Platonic love:" Plato saw
love as motivated by a longing for the highest Form of beautyâ€”The Beautiful Itself, and
love as the motivational power through which the highest of achievements are possible.
Because they tended to distract us into accepting less than our highest potentials, however,
Plato mistrusted and generally advised against physical expressions of love.
