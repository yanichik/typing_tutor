A pencil is an implement for writing or drawing constructed of a narrow, solid pigment
core inside a protective casing which prevents the core from being broken and/or from
leaving marks on the userâ€™s hand during use. Pencils create marks by physical abrasion,
leaving behind a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other
surface. They are distinct from pens, which instead dispense liquid or gel ink onto the
surface being marked. Most pencil cores are made of graphite powder mixed with a clay
binder. Graphite pencils (traditionally known as 'lead pencils') are used for both writing
and drawing and produce durable grey or black marks that can be erased easily. Though writing
is easily removable with an eraser, it is otherwise resistant to moisture, most chemicals,
ultraviolet radiation and natural aging. Other types of pencil core are less widely used,
such as charcoal pencils, which are mainly used by artists for drawing and sketching.
Coloured pencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts,
but are typically regarded as art supplies, especially those with waxy core binders that
tend to smear on paper instead of erasing. Grease pencils have a softer, crayon-like waxy
core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain.
