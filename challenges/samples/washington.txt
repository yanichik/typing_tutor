George Washington (February 22, 1732[b][c] – December 14, 1799) was a political leader,
general, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the
United States (1789–1797). He commanded Patriot forces in the new nation's
American Revolutionary War and led them to victory over the British. Washington also
presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which established the new federal
government. For his leadership he has been called the "Father of His Country".
Washington was born to a successful family of planters and slaveholders in colonial
Virginia. He had educational opportunities and at age seventeen launched a successful
career as a land surveyor. He then became a leader of the Virginia militia in the
French and Indian War. During the Revolutionary War he was a delegate to the
Continental Congress, was unanimously appointed commander-in-chief of the Army,
and led an allied campaign to victory at the Siege of Yorktown which ended the
conflict. Once victory was in hand in 1783, he resigned as commander-in-chief.
